* GradBoosting.ipynb contains simple gradient boosting implementation (best orthogonal split)
* GradBoostingLin.ipynb contains implementation of boosting with split by arbitrary plane.  
  The algorithm is taken from [L. Breiman Classification and Regression Trees](https://www.amazon.com/Classification-Regression-Wadsworth-Statistics-Probability/dp/0412048418/) section 5.2.2
* XGBoosting.ipynb is classical implementation of xgboosting algorithm

There are also 2 articles (in Russian), about the implemented methods,  
Note: I'm not the author of the articles, but articles are based on my code.
